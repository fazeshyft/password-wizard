# PASSWORD WIZARD üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

**Password Wizard** is a simple command-line program that playfully mutates any phrase you give it into a strong and memorable password for everyday use. It substitutes characters, adds random suffixes, and even hides an Easter egg if you know the magic word.

‚ö†Ô∏è **DISCLAIMER:** This tool is provided as-is and is **not** a cryptographically secure password generator. It may not meet security requirements for sensitive or professional use. Users are responsible for assessing suitability.
